# Shopping List Web App
A lightweight, client-side shopping list application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides a seamless user experience with full CRUD functionality — allowing users to add, edit, filter, and delete items in real time.

Leverages the browser's localStorage API to persist data across sessions, eliminating the need for user authentication or a backend server. Built entirely on the front-end, the project demonstrates core web fundamentals and an understanding of client-side state management.

Key highlights:
- Zero-dependency, framework-free implementation using pure JavaScript
- LocalStorage integration for persistent, session-independent data storage
- Dynamic filtering to quickly find items within the list
- Clean, responsive UI built with vanilla CSS
